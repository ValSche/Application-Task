# Application-Task

How to build:

1. Make a local clone
2. Export the application
3. Run the application in your console
(Alternatively you can run it directly in your IDE)

Assumptions: 

No books, food and medical products will be entered besides the mentioned ones in the PDF. (Otherwise they won't be recognized as tax exempt products and the normal sales tax will apply. However, if desired, the list could be extended to recognize these too.)
